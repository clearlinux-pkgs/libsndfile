This is also fixed by cve-2018-13139.patch, according to 
https://github.com/erikd/libsndfile/issues/427:

	This is the main problem.  If a file defines a number of channels >
	MAX_CHANNELS we should either artificially reduce the number of
	channels or reject it.

	Hence this issue is not a duplicate of #346 but rather a duplicate of
	#397 fixed in aaea680.
